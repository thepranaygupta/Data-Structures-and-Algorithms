# Trapping Rain Water Problem 
## Problem Statement

Given n non-negative integers representing an elevation map where the width of each bar is 1, compute how much water it can trap after raining.

>**Example 1:**
>
>**Input:** height = [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]
>
>**Output:** 6
>
>**Explanation:** The above elevation map (black section) is represented by array [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]. In this case, 6 units of rain water (blue section) are being trapped.

>**Example 2:**
>
>**Input:** height = [4,2,0,3,2,5]
>
>**Output:** 9

>**Constraints:**
>
>-   n == height.length
>-   0 <= n <= 3 * 104
>-   0 <= height[i] <= 105
