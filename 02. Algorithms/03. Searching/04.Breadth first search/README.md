## AIM
To implement breadth first search

## PURPOSE
The purpose is to understand the functioning of DFS Algorithm 

## Short description of package/script
First the graph is created, according to the edges entered by the user.

The details of visited nodes are maintained.

According to the algorithm, all the nodes are traversed one by one.

## Workflow of the Project
Description of functions used in the code and their purpose:

add->to enqueue elements in the queue

delete->to dequeue elements from the queue

bfs->to do the bfs traversal from the created tree in the main function

## Compilation Steps

1.Get the number of vertices.

2.Input the graph 

3.create a adjacency matrix from the input graph data

4.Get the source vertex 

5.Do BFS traversal starting from the soruce vertex and print the elements
